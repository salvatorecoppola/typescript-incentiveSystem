# Startup Incentives

## Description

The "Startup Incentives" project is a TypeScript application that assigns financial incentives to startups based on specific eligibility criteria. This project was developed to simplify the incentive allocation process and to provide a practical example of how to use TypeScript to manage business logic.

## Features

- **Incentive Allocation**: Evaluates whether a startup meets eligibility criteria and assigns financial incentives accordingly.
- **Citizen Participation**: Allows citizens to participate in sports activities offered by startups based on their sports interests.
- **Console Log Output**: Displays informative messages in the console to track the operations performed.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: For writing typed JavaScript code.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.
- **ts-node**: For running TypeScript files directly without a separate compilation phase.
